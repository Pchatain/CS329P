This is code for our project in CS329P (Practical Machine Learning) for fall quarter, 2021.

Authors: Wenxin Dong, Hansol Lee, Thanawat Sornwanee, Peter Chatain

Our project works with the EdNet dataset for knowledge tracing. 
We explore distilation techniques and methods for interpreting deep neural networks.
In particular, we were able to significantly improve the interpretability of soft decision trees
while preserving accuracy.
